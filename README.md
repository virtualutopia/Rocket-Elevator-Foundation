1- Create the postgres database : rake dataTransfert:create_psql_db         /!\ You'ill probably need to change the information to connect to psql database

3- Load the data of the old table :  rake dataTransfert:transfer_for_fact   /!\ You'ill probably need to change the information to connect to psql database
4- Load the new table with data :  rake dataTransfert:newTableData          /!\ You'ill probably need to change the information to connect to psql database
