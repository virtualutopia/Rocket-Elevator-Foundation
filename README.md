# Rocket_Elevators_Controllers
Week 7

Site is now online at https://faridrocket.com/. Rails, mySQL and postgreSQL was used to make this possible.

Admin :     admin@hotmail.com/////111111 (6 times 1)
Basic User:       user@hotmail.com/////111111  (6 times 1)

The intervention section is only accessible to the employees. So use please login as the Admin to check this page.
you may want to check the intevention form at app>views>intervention>_form.html.rb
related controller is at app>controller>interventions_controller.rb


Steps to test the API:
/!\ There is already and admin account. For the test, I would suggest to also create an user account to test the authorization.
# Zendesk
    1- log in as an employee using admin credentials (provided above)
    2- Fill a new intervention form at https://faridrocket.com/interventions/new
    3- Then access our Zendesk account online at https://www.zendesk.com/login/
    4- Use the credentials already sent to the client
    5- Access the "Views" page to check out the received tickets

# REST API
    there is a separate GitHub repository for this API at https://github.com/virtualutopia/Rocket-Elevator-Foundation-RESTapi.git
    Details are provided at the README file
